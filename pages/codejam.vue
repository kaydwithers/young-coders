            h3 Founder - Young Coders AU
            h5 Kruti loves new, innovative, creative and emerging technologies and is an advocate of such within developer community and beyond. Kruti’s passion for technology made her finalist of B&T Women in Tech Awards 2017. With the help of two mentors already known for their genius within the industry, she was empowered to introduce herself into the tech industry as a very outspoken, technically strong, confident individual which led her to delivering engaging tech talks and workshops includes General Assembly, Pause Festival, Future Assembly and Google Developers Meetups just to name a few. She is a passionate feminist and diversity advocate not only within the industry but in the greater community. This has encouraged her to sit on multiple diversity panels including Academy XI and General Assembly’s “I look like a Developer.” Kruti feels that the future is about diversity and cross team collaboration, which translated in a talk she gave recently, at MADC, alongside Creative Director Carmela Soares, about how a more diverse approach to the traditional ‘Creative Team’ can enrich both creative and technology based work. She feels that the up and coming generation of young coders is imperative to the economy as those jobs become increasingly more important in every industry, Kruti created ‘Young Coders’ - a non-for-profit education initiative run by a collective of developers, designers, managers and tech individuals alike that are passionate about giving back to the community that raised them. Through her Young Coders program, she wants to provide access to technology to those who don’t have it available to better set them up for the future and where the world is headed. In addition to educating the next generation, she would like to empower the tight community of volunteers that help her run the program to become successful leaders within their respective careers. Her dedication to empowering females within her field has landed her multiple editorials related to Women in Tech and a feature within B&T’s own ‘Women in Media’.
